## ü¶ä Introduction

This repository houses my Nix Configurations for my entire system. `config.nix` acts as a highly configurable system definition and the rest of the project is used to build and deeply customize my applications in a highly repeatable manner across different operating systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è TODO

This repository is not fully setup and the parts that are, are still a little new below is a list of what I have left todo before considering this configuration complete.

- Packages
  - Microsoft Office
  - A Password Manager
    - It would be nice if it had cli features
    - Raycast support
    - Integrated with Nix setup?
  - Lunar Client
- Settings
  - Darwin
    - The dock
    - Keybindings
    - Anything else I have changed
      - I don't know if there is a good way to see this
  - Visual Studio Code
    - Cleanup User Settings
    - Move User Settings into Nix
    - Audit Keybindings
    - Move Keybindings Into Nix
    - Handle Extensions
  - GitKraken
    - I think these settings exist in `spotandjake/.gitkraken`
    - Try to make a home manager module and upstream
  - Iterm2
    - I think these settings exist in `spotandjake/.iterm2`
    - Try to make a home manager module and upstream
- Research
  - Secrets
    - Do I just use a password manager?
    - Git Signing Keys
    - Gitkraken Authentication
    - Local passkeys
    - nixops
  - Home Manager GPG
    - Look into gpg through git manager idk if git handles it
  - Impersistance
    - This makes any file not in the config act as temporary until the system reboots.
    - I need to handle this last as I don't want to nuke my settings
- My files
  - I need to figure out how I will be backing up my files
    - documents
    - minecraft world
    - desktop?
  - Can I have nix-darwin or a script set up icloud
    - Documents is the main one I need to backup but it would be nice to be able to add others
    - I do not want to backup every folder in Documents
    - I have had permissions and terminal issues in the past with Icloud
- One Password
  - What needs to be brought over to here.
- General
  - Reset my Mac to this
- Cleanup
  - This is my first real Nix setup and I did some things in a non favorite way below is a list of cleanup.
  - Simplify `home/default.nix`
  - Improve `lib/default.nix`
  - Make a custom module system based around `./config.nix`
  - Remove configured settings in `modules/darwin/default.nix`
    - This sets up `nix-darwin` but I want this stuff to be configurable from `./config.nix`

#### Rewrite

- nix tips
  - only access inputs in the flake.nix
- flake parts module system
- home-manager nix darwin
- home-manager nixos
- flake.nix
  - reads system.nix
  - starts nix-parts
    - perSystem???
    - runs a
  - starts either nix-darwin or nixos depending
- lib
  - readme.md
    - I think this is just a standard nix parts module exposing the feature depending on the platform
    - inputs: systems, utils
    - outputs: I don't know yet a standard flake part I think
  - nix-darwin.nix
    - maps all system.nix for any darwin platform
    - get the user for system with utils.getSystemUser
    - maps the dock settings
    - figure out how homebrew works here???
    - maps any brew scripts - how do I do this with home-manager
  - nixos.nix
    - maps all system.nix for any darwin platform
    - maps the dock settings
    - figure out how homebrew works here???
- systems.nix
  - array
    - name: string
    - username: string
    - platform: string
    - specs:
      - cpu
      - memory
      - storage
- utils
  - getSystemUser
    - given a system returns a user configuration
- secrets.toml
  - users array
- users
  - readme.md
    - this contains my user definitions
    - user handle all home-manager configuration
    - they may expose
    - inputs: bundles
    - outputs: username, darwinConfiguration, nixosConfiguration, secretConfig
  - spotandjake.nix - I don't know if i love this layout just yet
    - username: spotandjake
    - darwinConfiguration
      - dock
    - nixosConfigurations
      - I don't know quite yet
    - secretConfig
      - the configuration toml for opnix
- bundles
  - readme.md
    - this contains prebuilt app bundles used by users
    - this contains my
    - inputs: none
    - outputs: sharedPrograms, darwinPrograms, nixosPrograms
  - minDevelopment.nix
    - contains the minimal nix development apps
    - sharedPrograms: nushell, git, vim
    - darwinPrograms:
    - nixosPrograms:
  - devShell.nix
    - sharedPrograms: vscode, gitkraken, yazi
    - darwinPrograms: iterm2
    - nixosPrograms:
  - workStation.nix
    - sharedPrograms: discord,
    - darwinPrograms: raycast, arc
    - nixosPrograms:
- apps
  - readme.md
    - This folder contains app configurations
  - app.nix
    - inputs:
    - just loads all the folder items into the module system
  - program
    - default.nix
      - inputs:
      - program configurations
- configurations
  - readme.md
    - this folder contains
  - ## systems.toml
  - converter
    - maps the toml input file into a nix module
    - with typechecking???? (How do we do this exactly)
  - users
    - spotandjake.nix
  - bundles
    - devShell.nix

* nix-darwin / nixos should manager global machine
* home-manager should handle per user
* opnix is per user and should run along side home-manager

* use this https://github.com/mrjones2014/opnix
* you are going to need to rewrite you app
* basically build all the program configurations using nixs module system
* then pass them in as a static config to the various programs using filters???
* https://github.com/zhaofengli/nix-homebrew/tree/main to install homebrew
* nix-darwin, nixos, nix impersistance at the top level and then home-manager and oxnix as submodules of those that take the builtConfig
* this will all be based on two things
* you will make hosts.nix a json file
  - this will have a list of hosts
  - systemName
  - system-architecture
  - use-home-manager
    - this will need to dissable
  - use-impersistance
    - this needs to enable the module both under home-manager and the top level flake
* you will make users.nix a json file
  - actually maybe make this a yaml or toml file
  - I like yaml
  - Try to make this work with the nix mkSystem?
    - maybe the configuration itself is a nix module???
    - mkOption
    - mkDescription
    - take a look at how home manager does this
    - we will have a loader file which takes our json does a few transforms
      - convert users into a list with username as field
      - provide the json as the nix module fulfilling the config
  - configuration (Basic Data Type)
    - darwin
      - settings
      - programs: { [key: string]: program }
        - program
          - enable: boolean
          - options: jsonObject
      - secrets
        - this will be based off whatever opnix needs
    - nixos
      - settings
      - programs
      - secrets
    - shaded
      - settings
      - programs
      - secrets
  - sharedConfigurations: { [name: string]: configuration }
  - users: { [name: string]: { configuration, list(string) } [key: string]: configuration }
* nix yaml config
* write a superset transpiler that can compile pretty nix into nix, we can use %%% %%% blocks for direct inlays.
  - ...spread
  - reasonML style `let`
  - arrow functions

## ü¶ã Inspiration

- [Initial Nix Setup On Mac](https://nixcademy.com/posts/nix-on-macos/)
  - This blog post is a great walkthrough on how to setup `nix-darwin` for Mac.
- [Dotfiles Configuration](https://github.com/nmasur/dotfiles)
  - This is a very popular repository for managing dotfiles with Nix.
  - It was helpful in figuring out the language and a repo structure.
- [Nixos-config](https://github.com/mitchellh/nixos-config)
  - This was a nix config I really liked and found helpful when setting up my configurations.
- [NixOS-Configuration](https://github.com/TheMaxMur/NixOS-Configuration)
  - This was the most helpful repository, my structure is closely based off of this.
